      <h1> About Måneskin</h1>

      <p>Måneskin are an Italian rock band formed in Rome in 2016. The band is composed of lead vocalist Damiano David,
        bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio. Performing in the streets in
        their early days, Måneskin rose to prominence after coming in second in the eleventh season of the Italian
        version of X Factor in 2017. Their international breakthrough occurred when the foursome won the Eurovision Song
        Contest 2021 for Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni".</p>

      <p>Måneskin have released three studio albums, Il ballo della vita (2018), Teatro d'ira: Vol. I (2021), and Rush!
        (2023), plus an extended play, Chosen (2017), and 13 singles, which have topped Italian and European music
        charts. They have received 34 platinum and seven gold certifications from FIMI, and have sold over a million
        records in Italy before their post-Eurovision breakthrough. Previously, the band's most successful Italian
        single was "Torna a casa". In 2021, Måneskin became the first Italian rock band to reach the top 10 on the UK
        Singles Chart, with the songs "Zitti e buoni", "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and a cover of The Four Seasons'
        "Beggin'" reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, receiving multiple international
        certifications for sales of over three million copies internationally, and four million in total. They received
        their first Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 2023 Grammy Awards.</p>
