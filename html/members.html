        Damiano David (born 8 January 1999) is an Italian singer and
        songwriter. He is the frontman of the rock band Måneskin, which won the Sanremo Music Festival 2021 and
        subsequently the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 representing Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni". David was born
        in Rome to Daniele David and Rosa Scognamiglio, both flight attendants. Due to the nature of his parents'
        work, he and his older brother Jacopo travelled worldwide from an early age, introducing them to various
        cultures. Until he was 17, he showed some talent playing basketball as a point guard at the local club
        Eurobasket Roma. He recalls that the basketball experience gave him fundamental discipline to succeed in his
        life.

        visible. He's known for his talent in drumming and his long hair. He also throws his drum sticks towards the

        Thomas raggi is the guitarist. He and victoria were already friends before they met Damiano and Ethan. Together
        they were in search of more band members to start a music career. Thomas Raggi is known for his eccentric style
        and his raw guitar solos during their concerts. He is a fan of the popular guitarist Slash and takes inspiration
        from him. Thomas is the youngest member out of the group and when the band got more popular he was only 16.
