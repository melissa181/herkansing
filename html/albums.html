                Chosen is the debut extended play by Italian rock band Måneskin. It was released on 8 December 2017 and
                peaked at number 3 on the Italian Albums Chart.
                The EP includes the single with the same name and another original song ("Recovery"), both in English,
                and various cover songs performed during the eleventh season of X Factor Italia.[3] The EP was certified

                Outside Italy and post-Eurovision success, the band's rock cover of "Beggin'" by The Four Seasons became
                the most popular song from the record.

                Il ballo della vita ('The dance of life') is the debut studio album by Italian pop rock band
                Måneskin. It was
                released on 26 October 2018. The album peaked at number one on the Italian Albums Chart, managed to
                reach Top 20
                on European music charts, and received a triple platinum certification by FIMI. The album includes
                the hit
                singles "Morirò da re", "Torna a casa", "Fear for Nobody", "L'altra dimensione" and "Le parole
                lontane". Like in the previous EP Chosen, Il ballo della vita is a modern Italian pop rock record with
                influences from
                funk, reggae and ska. In an The Upcoming interview, the band cited Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, Harry
                Styles, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Bruno Mars as inspirations for the album.
                The album's title is meaning a "celebration of youth, of freedom". The central figure of the album's
                lyrics
                is the fictional muse "Marlena", a "woman who represents beauty and the message we want to communicate:
                a
                message of freedom of choice, of attitude, of style to which we have tried to give a face, a name and a
                voice". Another protagonist is a man who wants to be with her until the very end. According to Damiano
                David,
                she is also a "personification of the fear of not being able to be oneself. Man is security, believing
                in
                oneself, like a father or an older brother, and he takes this woman into an objectively uncomfortable
                situation
                to bring her to a better version: not changing her, but making her accept herself, her aspirations".
                Five out of twelve songs in the album contain lyrics in English: "New Song", "Sh*t Blvd", single "Fear
                for
                Nobody", "Are You Ready?" and "Close to the Top".

        <section class="albumright">

            <p> Teatro d'ira: Vol. I is the second studio album by Italian rock band Måneskin. It was released
                on 19 March
                2021 through RCA and Sony. It includes the singles "Vent'anni" and the Sanremo and
                Eurovision-winning "Zitti e
                buoni", as well as the songs "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and "Coraline".
                Following Måneskin's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with "Zitti e buoni", the album
                started
                appearing on weekly charts across Europe. It peaked at number one on the Italian albums chart,
                and was certified
                quintuple platinum by FIMI. It also reached number one on the Finnish, Lithuanian, and Swedish
                album charts and
                reached the top ten of the charts in fourteen other territories. It has since received three
                other gold music.
                certifications in three other countries. According to the band, the project's title "Teatro d'ira"
                ("theatre of wrath") and meaning are of "cathartic anger aimed at oppressions and oppressors,
                which leads to venting and rebelling against everything that makes you feel wrong and which, as a
                result, leads to a rebirth and change. We wanted to place this very powerful force in a context, that of
                the theater, which in the common imagination is perceived as elegant and calm. We like this antithesis:
                a contrast that lives when the curtain opens and, instead of a show or a ballet, we find ourselves
                catapulted into this explosion of energy. Theatre is a metaphor to represent art, the place where this
                powerful impulse generates something artistic and positive.</p>

            <p> Rush! is the third studio album by Italian rock band Måneskin, released on 20 January 2023 through Epic
                Records. It was preceded by the singles "Mammamia", "Supermodel", "The Loneliest", and "Gossip", with
                "Baby
                Said" following on 3 March 2023. In support of the album and its predecessor Teatro d'ira: Vol. I
                (2021), the
                band is embarking on the Loud Kids Tour and the Rush! World Tour throughout 2022 and 2023. Måneskin
                recorded "probably 50" songs for the album, which they recorded in part in Los Angeles with producer Max
                Martin. The band revealed that they had been working on their "debut international album" with Martin
                and the MXM and Wolf Cousins team, including Savan Kotecha and Mattman & Robin, extensively after
                meeting them the previous year. The single "Supermodel", which was worked on with Martin and Rami
                Yacoub, was premiered live during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2022. The band later
                teased a song on the album called "Gasoline", written in support of Ukraine after the 2022 Russian
                invasion, also made by the team. </p>

                Records. It was preceded by the singles "Mammamia", "Supermodel", "The Loneliest", and "Gossip", with

                2023. A reissue titled Rush! (Are U Coming?) was released on 10 November 2023, supported by the
                single "Honey (Are U Coming?)". They were also influenced during the writing and recording process after
                listening to Radiohead, with bassist Victoria De Angelis stating that Måneskin had "tried to experiment
                a bit more with [their] sound. We listened to a lot of Radiohead where they work a lot with pedals."
                Frontman Damiano David said: "I think that the inspiration we got from Radiohead was to be very focused
                on creating a very specific world for each song. It's something they do very, very well so we tried to
                create these amazing atmospheres. They really create an image of what you're listening to, and that gave
                us inspiration."</p>
